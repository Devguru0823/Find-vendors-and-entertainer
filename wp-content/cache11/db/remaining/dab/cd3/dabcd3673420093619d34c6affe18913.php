Vendorflock‚Äôs license to Your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that Vendorflock‚Äôs license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the Services.

<strong><u>PURCHASES</u></strong>

Products and services may be offered for purchase through iTunes, Google Play, or other ‚Äú<strong>Third Party</strong> <strong>Services</strong>‚Äù authorized by Vendorflock. These purchases are referred to as ‚Äú<strong>Third Party Purchases</strong>.‚Äù By accessing the Website and Services You agree to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of any Third Party Services. Purchases may also be made through the Website directly (‚Äú<strong>Internal Purchases</strong>‚Äù)

<strong><u>AUTOMATIC RENEWALL</u></strong>

If You purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew until You cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to You at the time of purchase. If You cancel Your subscription, You will continue to have access to Your subscription benefits until the end of Your subscription period, at which point it will expire.

Because our Services may be utilized without a subscription, canceling Your subscription does not remove Your profile from our Services. If You wish to fully terminate Your membership, You must terminate Your membership as set forth in the Termination section of these Terms of Use.

<strong><u>INTERNAL PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS</u></strong>

If You make an Internal Purchase, You agree to pay the price listed in addition to any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on Your payments. Prices and tax amounts may change from time to time. By providing a ‚Äú<strong>Payment Method</strong>‚Äù for the purchase, You authorize Vendorflock to charge that Payment Method. Vendorflock may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if Vendorflock has already requested or received payment. If You initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with Your Payment Method, Vendorflock may, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate Your account. If Your chargeback or payment reversal is overturned, please contact Customer Service at <a href="mailto:service@vendorflock.com">service@vendorflock.com</a>.

If Your Internal Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, Your Payment Method will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until You cancel it. After Your initial subscription commitment period, Your subscription will automatically continue for the price and duration You agreed to when You initially subscribed.

To cancel a subscription: You must use the Cancellation Button on the Website. If You cancel a subscription, You may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of Your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when Your then-current term expires.

You may edit Your Payment Method information by submitting Your request to <a href="mailto:service@vendorflock.com">service@vendorflock.com</a>. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and You do not update or edit Your Payment Method information or cancel Your subscription, You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize Vendorflock to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to Your payment billing dates. You further authorize Vendorflock to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for Your Payment Method as provided by Your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of Your payment will be based on Your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between You and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of Your chosen Payment Method.

<strong><u>THIRD PARTY PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS</u></strong>

Purchases on the Website may be made through a Third Party Service, such as with an Apple ID or Google account (‚Äú<strong>Your Third Party Service Account</strong>‚Äù), and Your Third Party Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to You at the time of purchase and with the applicable terms and conditions of Your Third Party Service Account. Some Third Party Services may charge You sales tax, depending on where You live, which may change from time to time.

If Your Third Party Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, Your Third Party Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until You cancel it. After Your initial subscription commitment period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and duration You agreed to when You initially subscribed.

To cancel a subscription: If You do not want Your subscription to renew automatically, or if You want to change or terminate Your subscription, You must log in to your Third Party Service Account and follow the Third Party Service‚Äôs instructions on how to manage or cancel Your subscription. Deleting the App from Your Device nor deleting Your account with Vendorflock cancels Your subscription. You must cancel it through the Third Party Service. For example, if You subscribed using Your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not Vendorflock. If You cancel a subscription, You may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of Your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when Your then-current term expires.

If You initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with Your Third Party Service Account, Vendorflock may, in its sole discretion, immediately terminate Your account. If Your chargeback or payment reversal is overturned, please contact Customer Service at <a href="mailto:service@vendorflock.com">service@vendorflock.com</a>. Vendorflock will retain all funds charged to Your Third Party Service Account until You cancel Your subscription through Your Third Party Service Account.

<strong><u>VIRTUAL ITEMS</u></strong>

‚Äú<strong>Virtual Items</strong>‚Äù are limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, personal, revocable licenses to use or access specific limited-use features available for purchase exclusively from Vendorflock. Virtual Items represent a limited license right governed by these Terms of Use, and, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned to You. Any Virtual Item balance shown in Your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license. The license granted to You in Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use should not be interpreted as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items.

Vendorflock, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items. Vendorflock may regulate, control, alter, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time and shall not be held liable for doing so. Virtual Items shall not be transferred or sold in any way.
